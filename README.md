# MediaWiki extensions developed by Microsoft

Microsoft has developed a collection of MediaWiki extensions for use internally. Select extensions are
currently being considered for open source release. These extensions will be made available under
the MIT License. Volunteers who are employees of Microsoft are responsible for overseeing the open
sourcing and maintenance of the extensions in conjunction with the original development team(s).
Open source contributions from the community are welcome and will be subject to Microsoft's CLA.
