# MediaWiki extensions developed by Microsoft

Microsoft has developed a collection of MediaWiki extensions for internal use. Select extensions are
currently being considered for open source release. These extensions will be made available under
the MIT License. Volunteers who are employees of Microsoft are responsible for overseeing the open
sourcing and maintenance of the extensions in conjunction with the original development team(s).
Open source contributions from the community are welcome and will be subject to Microsoft's CLA.

Microsoft's MediaWiki extensions are made publicly available on GitHub and will be officially maintained
exclusively on Microsoft GitHub repos. While we recognize that many MediaWiki extension developers
choose to host their extension source code on Wikimedia source control, we currently do not have plans
to move our extension code from GitHub to Wikimedia source control. Please see the
[Contributing](#contributing) and [Trademarks](#trademarks) section of this README for information
on how to contribute to this repo and all other open source Microsoft repos on GitHub.
